YoutubeMixer
============

**Version** 0.11
**Author:** John32B
**Initial Release:** 03-2015

----------

__YoutubeMixer__ is a javascript experiment. It will play youtube videos on the background of the page and mix them using a crossfade effect.

###### _A video transition in progress_

### [Click Here for a Demo In action](http://john32b.github.io/youtubeMixer/)


## Features

- __Linear crossfade__ when changing videos (video & audio)
- Loop through multiple videos, or just loop one video forever.
- Playlist videos can have a starting and an ending time.
- Videos are __preloaded__, so that the transitions will be fluid without waiting.
- Videos are set on the background and are __dynamically resizable__ to match the window size.
-  Provides a simple flexible __API__ so that you can use it without much hassle.

## Notes
- This is an alpha version, there are bugs to fix and features to be covered in future versions.
- The embedded videos will display ads just like youtube. You can use an ad-blocker to remove them, or don't embed videos that feature ads.

#### Some known issues/bugs are:
- When a video can't load, the videos will stop altogether! Reasons a video won't load are _region lock/private/embed blocked/bad ID_. Hopefully will fix this at a later release.
- There is a bug, when you have visited a video on youtube.com and youtube puts a cookie to know the time where you left off, if you try to load that video on youtubeMixer, sometimes it will start at the wrong time. If such thing occurs, until fixed, use incognito mode on Chrome to skip reading the cookies.


# How to use

Import the __youtubemixer.js__ source file. This creates a global object named __youtubeMixer__.

```html
<script src="youtubemixer-min.js"></script>
```

Your `<body>` section of the HTML should be empty, or if you want to have any overlay content , you can do so by creating a single `<div>` element inside the body and putting all your content there.

When the DOM is loaded, you can add videos to the playlist,and then initialize and run the player. Checkout the __examples__ folder for a quick startup.


## YoutubeMixer API exposed functions

These are the functions you can interact with the object.

- [youtubeMixer.**playlistPush(..)**](#youtubeMixerplaylistPush)
- [youtubeMixer.**init(..)**](#youtubeMixerinit)
- [youtubeMixer.**eventHandler()**](#youtubeMixereventHandler)
- [youtubeMixer.**playNextVideo()**](#youtubeMixerplayNextVideo)
- [youtubeMixer.**getAudio()**](#youtubeMixergetAudio)
- [youtubeMixer.**setAudio()**](#youtubeMixersetAudio)


### youtubeMixer.playlistPush( id, parameters )

The first thing to do is to __add videos__ to the youtubeMixer playlist. Do this before calling __init()__; Videos on the playlist will __loop forever__

```javascript
 
id 	// [String]
	// The youtube ID of the video to play, e.g 'P5_GlAOCHyE'
	
parameters   // object holding parameters
{
	start    // [Int], optional
			 // Start time of the video in seconds.
			
	playfor  // [Int], optional
			 // Play for this many seconds. 
			 // If omitted will play the entire video
			 
	end      // [Int], optional
			 // Play video until this timestamp, in seconds. 
			 // If omitted will play the entire video
			 
	once     // [Boolean], optional
			 // Play the video only once, 
			 // If the playlist loops, this will not play again.
}

```

###### example:
```javascript
/* Will add the video "ht2TigJp88w" to the playlist
   The video will start playing at 520 seconds
   And it will last for 20 seconds */
youtubeMixer.playlistPush("ht2TigJp88w", { start:520, playfor:20 });
```


### youtubeMixer.init( parameters )
Once you have pushed some videos to the playlist, it's time to init and run the object. Calling this will __automatically__ start loading and playing videos from the 

#### Note on parameters.elementID
If you want to have overlay content, pass the ID of the DIV that has user content in it, and youtuberMixer will re-arrange the DOM so that this will overlay the player. __If omitted, be sure to have a clean HTML with no elements in it.__ Check the example files for more info

```javascript
parameters	// object holding parameters
{
	
	audio	// [Boolean], default = false
			// Start the player with the audio enabled or not.
	
	quality	// [String], default = 'default'
			// Force a quality for the videos played.
			// Valid values are:
			// highres, hd1080, hd720, large, medium, small, default
			
	useProgressBar // [Boolean], default = true
				   // Will add a simple progress bar on the bottom of the player.
				
	elementID  // [String], optional
			   // The element ID to use as the overlay.
}

```


###### example
```javascript
youtubeMixer.init({
	audio:true,
	useProgressBar:true,
	quality:"medium",
	screenMode:"fullsceen",
	elementID:"overlay"
});
```




### youtubeMixer.eventHandler( event, data )

youtubePlayer features a basic eventHandler for a quick and easy user feedback on basic events.
This is not a proper event emitter per-se, as only 1 listener can be active. It's more like an expanded callback, but instead of having 10+ callback functions, I decided to do this.

#### Override this function
```javascript
youtubeMixer.eventHandler = function(event,data)
{
	event // [String]
	      // The event type received
	      
	data  // [Array], optional
	      // Some events might push data among 
	      
    // user code to handle events
    
};
```

#### Events that can be emitted:

- __api-loading__
	- When the youTube API starts to load
- __api-ok__
	- When the youTube API is loaded.
- __error__
	- data:String = The error occured
- __resized__
	- Whenever the window is resized
	- data[0]:Int = New viewport width
	- data[1]:Int = New viewport height
- __video-loading__
	- data[0]:String = video ID
	- When a video player is loading.
- __video-ready__
	- data[0]:String = video ID
	- When a video has loaded and is ready to play.
- __video-buffering__
	- data[0]:String = video ID
	- When the active playing video is currently buffering
- __video-play__
	-  data[0]:String = video ID
	- When the active video starts playing, This is called whenever it resumes from buffering and on the first play of a video
- __time-update__
	- data[0]:Int = current Time of playing video
	- data[1]:Int = totalTime of playing video
	- Triggers every 1 second if the video is playing, sends the timestamp of the playing video.
- __playlist-update__
	- data[0]:Int = current Video index
	- data[1]:Int = total Videos
	- Triggers whenever the playing video changes. Sends the current video index of the playlist
- __swap-end__
	- When a crossfade between videos is finished
- __swap-start__
	- When a crossfade between videos starts
- __video-play-first__
	- Called only once, when the first video of the playlist starts playing.

###### example
```javascript
youtubeMixer.eventHandler = function(event,data)
{
    switch(event) {
	    case:"playlist-update":
		    console.log("Playing video#"+data[0]+ " of #"+data[1]);
		    // Output example:
		    // Playing video #1 of #16
	    break;
		
		case:"time-update":
			// Update  screen time indication.
			GUI_updateVideoTimer(data[0],data[1]);
		break;
	}
};
```
### youtubeMixer.playNextVideo( )
Plays the next video on the playlist. If that video is not ready yet, it will do nothing.

### youtubeMixer.getAudio( )
Returns Boolean, Whether or not the Audio is currently enabled on the player.

### youtubeMixer.setAudio( state )
```javascript
state	// [Boolean]
		// Enable or disable the audio of the player
```
